## WritingSamples

This repository contains writing samples from various courses throughout my degree programs.  

### General Writing and Presenting
The final project for my Globalization course included a written report and a PowerPoint presentation with audio.  The written report, [Globalization and Food]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/GlobalizationFinalProjectPartOne.docx) is a fun read with interesting food history facts.  It also shows my writing style and source referencing. The PowerPoint presentation, [Event Triggered Hunger]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/GlobalizationFinalProjectSlidePresentation.pptx) is an example of both visual and verbal communication.

### Data Projects
Examples of my writings in Data related courses include a [Gap Analysis]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/DAT300GapAnalysis.docx) and the [final project]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/FinalProjectFundamentalsOfDataMining.docx) from my Fundamentals of Data Mining course.  These, again, show my ability to communicate in writing as well as my understanding of these topics.

### Software Design and Development
I have included several samples in this category to show different types of written communication required in various circumstances.
The [Code Reflection]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/CodeReflectionPseudocodeAndTesting.docx) shows problem solving techniques, a pseudocode example, and displays some sample output in a clear and easy to read manner.

The [Software Design Document]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/CS%20465%20Software%20Design%20Document%20Final.docx) from my Full Stack Development course is an example of clear and concise reporting, graphing and describing visual aids.

The next three samples are all from my Capstone course project which you can review in its entirety [here](https://lesleyplangdon.github.io?CS499FinalProject/). 
[Computer Science Trends]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/CapstoneMod6Journal.docx) is a journal entry that demonstrates research, writing style and, since we could select any trends, gives a little insight into topics I find interesting.

I chose to share the [Milestone two narrative]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/CapstoneM2Narrative.docx) and [Milestone three narrative]( https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/WritingSamples/blob/master/CapstoneM3Narrative.docx) because the show my thought process and problem solving.  Things donâ€™t always work the first time.  My ability to work through a problem until I find a solution is one of my greatest strengths.
